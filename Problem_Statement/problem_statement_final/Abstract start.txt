American Helicopter Society invites student teams to participate in the 5th Annual Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) Student Challenge. Our project is to design a quadcopter that is capable of competing in this event on May 14-17. This project is sponsored by Nancy Squires Ph.D., in colaboration with Columbia Helicopters. Throughout this project we will be working in close coordination with a mechanical engineering team and an electrical engineering team to ensure that our micro-air vehical can meet the competition requirements. In order to compete our  vehicle must weigh less than 500 grams, be shorter than 17.7 inches in any dimension, maintain a stable flight path, and have an on-board camera system.
