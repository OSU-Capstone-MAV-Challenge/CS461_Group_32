SourceCode:

Here you will find both our testing code and the code used for this project. The code located in the testing folder is broken down into individual contributions and may contain duplicate examples to code we have implemented on the final design. 

The final design code is separated into two directories. One is for the base station, and the other is for use on the aircraft.
